# Learning Python

You've learned Ruby, C, C++, JavaScript and SQL. Getting started with a totally new language doesn't have to be hard. The biggest key is to practice doing something that you *already know* in the context of the new language. This is called a *transfer task*. The more languages and computer science concepts you learn, the easier new ones become to pick up and its mostly syntax, quirks and language-specific tools that become the tricky part.

Now, your task is to *teach yourself* a bit of Python. The goal here isn't to become a Python master, but to explore and learn a bit about a new language.

## Goals:

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

- Create a simple python program
- Execute a simple python program
- Articulate basic differences between Python and other languages you know
- Feel comfortable understanding what is generally happening in most basic python programs

## Research: What is Python

Your first task is to research Python to be able to understand some of its basic concepts. Edit this `README.md` file to answer the below questions:

##### What paradigms does Python support?

##### What typing discipline does it follow?

##### Is it a high or low level language?

##### Does it have built in memory management and garbage collection?

##### What languages was Python influenced by?

##### Is it a compiled or interpeted language?

##### Does it have strong support for functional programming?

##### What's the deal with Python 2 vs Python 3?

##### How do you open a REPL for Python?

##### How does one execute a Python program?

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
> Explicit is better than implicit.
> Simple is better than complex.
> Complex is better than complicated.
> Flat is better than nested.
> Sparse is better than dense.
> Readability counts.
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
> Although practicality beats purity.
> Errors should never pass silently.
> Unless explicitly silenced.
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
> Now is better than never.
> Although never is often better than *right* now.
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
